# flocking
Messing around with flocking behavioral algorithms - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocking_(behavior)

I wanted to make this more efficient so I tried implementing space partitioning, which was going well, but mid-way through implementing it, the flocks still worked, when they really shouldn't have. I realised I wasn't even updating the grid reference the boids were in, but it still looked amazing.

In short, I have genuinely no idea how this program works, outside of the standard cohesion, alignment, and separation part.

If you can make use of this or explain to me how this works, please do! I have commented it pretty well, along with the parts that I don't understand at all!
